Guessing Game

# This is a simple guessing game by https://twitter.com/timolinn_ - go follow him on twitter
#
#So I thought to modify the game a bit...
#
#Instead of just randomizing and checking infinitely, the game checks over 3 loops if the user is correct.
#
#If within 3 loops the user can guess correctly, it prints "Wonderful!(In Japanese) You Live!!!"
#
#As the program loops and the user inputs a wrong guess, it prints "Wrong! try again!"
#
#At the 3rd wrong answer, the program ends and prints "Wrong!!! You are already dead (In Japanese)"
